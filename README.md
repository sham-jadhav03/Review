# Understanding AI Agents and LLMs

## 1. Knowledge-Based Agents (KBA)

### What is a Knowledge-Based Agent?
A **Knowledge-Based Agent (KBA)** operates using explicit knowledge of the world, expressed as rules, facts, and logic.

*   **Normal Agent**: Reacts primarily based on immediate perception.
*   **Knowledge-Based Agent**: Reasons, deduces, and predicts outcomes before acting.

### Architecture
Based on the AIMA (Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach) model, a KBA has four core components:

1.  **Knowledge Base (KB)**: A database of facts and rules, usually represented in propositional or first-order logic.
    *   *Example Rule*: "If it rains, the ground gets wet."
2.  **Inference Engine**: The "reasoning brain" that applies logical rules to deduce new information from existing facts.
3.  **Tell()**: The mechanism for adding new percepts or facts to the Knowledge Base.
4.  **Ask()**: The mechanism for querying the Knowledge Base (e.g., "Is the Wumpus in square (2,3)?").

### Workflow
1.  **Perceives**: The agent receives input and **Tells** the KB.
2.  **Reasons**: The KB + Inference Engine deduce new conclusions.
3.  **Acts**: The agent performs actions based on these conclusions.

> **Corporate Analogy**: Think of a KBA as a data-driven decision-making system for an organization—like a CIO equipped with a comprehensive fact sheet and a specific rulebook for making decisions.

## 2. Prompt Engineering & Tokenization

To effectively work with modern AI, we must understand:
*   **Prompt Engineering**: How to structure instructions effectively (TELL, ASK, ACT).
*   **Token Generation**: How AI processes text into tokens and generates responses.
*   **API Interaction**: Understanding how Generative AI APIs handle requests and token generation across endpoints.

## 3. Large Language Models (LLMs) & RAG

### LLMs (Large Language Models)
LLMs understand and generate text based on vast training data. However, they have limitations, such as:
*   **Knowledge Cutoffs**: They only know information up to their last training date.
*   **Hallucinations**: They may confidently generate incorrect information.

### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
RAG enhances LLMs by adding a retrieval step. It fetches real-time, external data (from databases or documents) to ground the LLM's responses.

**Benefits of RAG:**
*   **Accuracy**: Reduces hallucinations by basing answers on retrieved facts.
*   **Domain Specificity**: Can answer questions about private or specific data.
*   **Citations**: Can provide sources for its answers.

### Context & Architecture
To ensure an LLM "remembers" context, we rely on architectures like the **Encoder-Decoder** model. This involves converting text into **embedding vectors**, which allow the model to understand semantic relationships and generate relevant text.

## 4. Deep Dive: Building & Training LLMs
Moving towards a deeper understanding involves:
1.  **Model Architecture**: Dissecting how LLMs work internally.
2.  **Training**: Understanding how basic LLMs are trained using Python libraries.
3.  **Pipelines**: Building custom RAG pipelines to connect LLMs with authoritative knowledge sources.

### RAG Pipeline Definition
> A **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline is an AI framework that enhances the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by connecting them with external, up-to-date knowledge bases. This allows the system to provide accurate, context-aware, and factually grounded responses, bridging the gap between static training data and real-world information.
